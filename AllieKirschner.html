			<p><b>Tell us about you Allie</b></p> 
			
			
			
		<p> My name is Allie Kirschner. By day I am the Vice President of Operations and Marketing Director at Passport Publications and Media, where we make custom magazines for organizations and government entities throughout the state of Florida. </p>
			
			
			
<div >

    <p>When I’m off the clock I am constantly pursuing making all kinds of art! I was lucky enough to attend art schools for most of my educational career; including Bak Middle School of the Arts, Dreyfoos High School of the Arts, and the School of Art and Art History, at the University of Florida, where I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts, with a focus in Sculpture.  </p>
		
   <p> <b>What inspired you to start making collage?</b> </p>
			
		<p>My passion for collage started in high school, when upon finding a picture of a blue jay; I had the intense impulse to recreate the colorful shapes its feathers made with paper. Five hours later I had a photo-realistic collage of a small blue jay made entirely of magazine clippings. </p>

    <p>That particular series ended a few months later with a photo-realistic peacock that took about 60 hours to create. Around the same time, I was given the opportunity to intern with world famous collage artist, Bruce Helander. Under his influence, I was pushed to really explore all that collage has to offer and left with countless lessons about the art world that I keep in mind to this day. Since then I’ve made it my mission to help define collage as a “fine art” form rather than “craft”, as many people in the art world tend to classify it. </p> 
			
			<hr>
			
			<p><b>What does your art talk about?</b></p>
			
			<p>The subjects that I incorporate into my works are vast and varied. Art is my way of venting the thoughts and feelings I have trouble verbalizing, so my work is often a reflection of my response to current events, trends, states of mind, or life experiences.  In a very broad sense, the thing I seem to focus on most in my work is the human condition.  </p>

			<p> <b>Many of your works we’ve seen on social media are all collages. Is collage making your only craft?
 </b></p>
			
				<p>Hardly! While collage is my favorite medium to work with, I like to get my hands messy and use other materials. I often like to create multimedia works, incorporating a variety of materials into my pieces, such as drawing or painting on collage. But generally, I like to do a little bit of everything, sculpting one day, painting the next, and drawing another!</p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<p> <b> What do you do when you’re not working?  </b></p>
			
			<p>When I’m not working, I’m often taking care of myself or spending time with my family. Personal health, both physically and mentally are incredibly important to me, so I work out regularly and actively pursue happiness. I am incredibly close with my family, so nothing leaves me feeling loved and recharged than sharing a meal with my siblings.

			<p> <b> What project are you currently working on? </b></p>
			
			<p>I’m currently working on a large-scale collage that I have temporarily dubbed my “Pandemic Piece”. As I am actively working on it, I regularly post detail shots and updates to Instagram @art_with_allie. This is a 3-foot by almost 4-foot collage, begun in March of this year that illustrates the thoughts and feelings that have been swimming around my brain while quarantined. 
 </p>
			
			
			<p> The piece is packed with people whose faces have been “masked” with the mouths and noses of other individuals. The mouths and noses from other people allow me to obscure not only the faces, but also identities of the people included, as the work is about people but no one person in particular. In essence, it’s about closeness, it’s about face touching, it’s about face obstruction, it’s about gender and sex, it’s about races and all ages, it’s about what we can’t have and what we do have.  </p>
