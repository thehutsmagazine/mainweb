                John was born on the 3rd of December, 1999 in Kogi state to a retired police officer and a business woman, where he grew up and learned his craft.
 He uses only the charcoal and graphite pencils to tackle his task on pelican, cardboard and glossy papers as he tells the story of heartbreak and silence through the several strokes he creates. He creates an expressive illusory that shows the figurative happenings of the mind and the feelings of a person on paper for the audience to see.</p>

<p>“People sometimes forget to see the message.” - The artist complained. Despite the copious feelings he poured in his work, many have failed to see the message, having carried away by it’s many details.
            </p>

            <p>
                 “I come from a creative family. I watched my elder brother repair radios, televisions, and other electronics without being taught by anyone. I wanted to be like my brother. I started out by drawing Ben 10 comic characters,” he mentioned. “Then my friend Dankay taught me a lot of techniques after which I started drawing.” 
            </p>
            <p> John had been an artist ever since then, getting many feedback from the people around him which was more of him never to stop drawing. The realist in fact thinks he had always had a flare for art ever since he was little and only a push or rather a spark and direction as he would call it, was all he needed to have the courage to take it up.
            </p>

            <p>
				After several years he ascertained hyper-realism which he decided to take up as his art style, spending hours after hours alone in his room to perfect his technique.
            </p>
			    <p>John doesn’t see himself floating from the path of Art later in future. He argued that he had a lot of inspirations to share to the world to drift away.
           </p>
            <p>
                 “I discovered hyper-realism in the 2020 lock-down caused by the Covid-19. I used the period to develop my skills alone in my room during the lock-down.” 
            </p>
			    <p>
                    John awards the highlight of his career to the interview he had with the gace95.5fm Lokoja. “It was my first time.” He said. “It was also a great opportunity for me.”
            </p>
			<p>
			The radio interview not only brought joy to his heart but it also taught the artist a lot about him self in ways he never thought of. “It taught me never to underestimate myself and to always put in my best in every piece I create.”
			</p>
			
			<p>
			 Getting deeper into the conversation, we were able to get wind of John’s new project which he titled, ‘Heartbreak.’ An irony of a sought for we saw it as a direct telling of what his works were all about. “It portrays a heartsick black woman whose new life has lost it’s meaning.” He said not giving away anything else as the work was yet to be completed. He mentions his inspiration was gotten from Johnson Ocheja and Ojingiri Peter, two established hyper-realists on Instagram.
