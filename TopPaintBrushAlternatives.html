            <p>
                Having a hairless paint brush is really an annoying thing that can happen in an artists life, especially when you have no means of getting another one. And what if you can’t afford a set of good brushes, or you’re just looking for a different functionality? Below you can find alternatives to use instead of paint brushes.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">FOAMS..</h2>
            <p>
                 Foams are not only one of the best alternative that works for me, but they can absorb and hold all types of paints just like how they absorb stains when used in the kitchen. Large foams can be cut into different shapes and sizes, depending on the artist using it, then it can be placed on a stick, springs, clipped with a peg or just used like that. The only downside I noticed using this method is that it takes several coatings if you want a deeper shade of color with watery paint.
            </p>
                <h2 class="content-subhead">COTTON BUDS..</h2>
            <p>
                  Cotton buds are known all over the world as an instrument to clean the insides of the ear. But what most of us don’t know is that this fluffy cotton on a stick can be used to apply colors on a canvas. When five of these are tied together, either by a string, twine or a rope, they are dipped into any kind of paint, acrylic I would say because I haven’t tried it yet with oil paints, and then applied to a canvas or what ever your surface is.
            </p>
                 <h2 class="content-subhead">PLASTIC BOTTLES..</h2>
            <p>
                   To me, plastic bottles cannot be used if you’re looking for a highly styled painting but can pose as a great painting option when looking to just have fun or you can give it to your children if they don’t have the real deal.  This should not stop artists who want to try out this for themselves, because this is only my opinion, you can have yours too.  To use this method, you deep the bottom of the bottle into your acrylic paint (I haven’t tried with oil paint either) and then you apply.
            </p>
			      <h2 class="content-subhead">TOILET PAPER ROLLS..</h2>
            <p>
                   Having seen this method on a video I came across on YouTube @FTJcraftideas, I decided to include it on this list. Getting your toilet paper roll is your first task, then you cut up the bottom with a scissor in any pattern you want, apply your color and your work is done. I would advice you to throw it away after use if you don’t want to stain your next work.
            </p>
			    
           
            <h2 class="content-subhead">FINGER..</h2>
            <p>
                 This method is the easiest and quickest method to use when looking for an alternative. It’s movable, easy to handle and it’s a part of the body.  Artist like Iris Scott, makes use of this method- using her fingertips, she discovered her own impressionistic style thus creating magnificent artworks. The application method is simple, just get your fingers garnished with paint and then create your magic work.
            </p>

                   All the best from the huts magazine team.
