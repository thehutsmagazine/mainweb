			<p>The preceding times can be a great inspiration to the doings of the present, and can alter perspectives of secondary viewers to certain situations. When incorporating an element associated with history, we discover there is a difference, a sort of spice it adds to the essential dealing with the present. Across the globe, several persons have held strong to beliefs–they see it to preserve, a sanctuary to hold tight cultural ethics and element to avoid extinction. Few use the past to create something new, an out of the box magic, and this has them singled out amongst many. For the Rwandan artist Izere, inspirations from different periods of art history, mostly from the art of impressionists who were engaged in open compositions and light changing depiction, gave birth to his impasto style.

		<i><p>“I enjoyed mostly their use of textured, torn, foundry colors and different grayscales.”</p></i>
			<hr>
		<b><p>How has your art evolved overtime? </p></b>
			
			
		<p>I can say it’s a tremendous journey, because at first trying these new techniques, I had no idea how my folks and society in general was going to relate to this new technique. After one year of developing this new technique, I was invited to one big exhibition ‘MUMASANGANO’ that was due in March 2019 at school of architecture in Kigali. It was a collective visual art exhibition of contemporary artists, and here is when I had a motivating reaction about it.  From then I started practicing it more, it visually portrayed the image of our textured lifestyles. Later on, I participated in different exhibitions and workshops. The love and support kept me creating.  I love the art world, and what I am creating. 

</p>					

			
			<b><p>What do you incorporate in your color palette? </p></b>
    <p>I’m pretty much basic on my color palette, but most of the time I don’t include black much.  I use different tones and unusual lighting which creates lights and shades accordingly. I always challenge myself in order to learn from every single piece I create, with different colors. </p>
		
			<b><p>You’ve sculpted and these works have been taking a unique turn in its characteristics. How did you start out sculpting and what challenges do you face balancing your talents? </p></b>
    <p>I have always been passionate about art and learning more, so I practiced many times. Challenges would be that we do have few art platforms around here, where I can share more of my daily works. But I always give my best for the best, and be able to share broadly.</p>
			
			<b><p>Your compositions have characters who are deeply engaged in powerful events. Are these art pieces drawn from your experiences or were you inspired by something else?</p></b>
    <p>It's a combination of both, I create stories from my community, and black people around the world. Sometimes I intervene with our past and the present. I do this by trying to relate stories of the past and the present because I believe it's a great combination and an inspiration to create from there. </p>

			<b><p>‘Priority’ is one of the biggest paintings you have created. The poise stance of the women and the male caught amongst them makes the painting powerful. Does the painting depict your traditional background?</p></b>
    <p>‘Priority’ is a story of an imaginary kingdom which illustrates the power of working collectively, regardless of gender, it shows the power of females {who are considered weak}. The costume of the people though does illustrate a bit of the western African countries attire. But it is also a personal portrayal that I have learnt throughout my life, the strength of women in my life and around in our community and their impact on where I am at right now. Starting from my Mother. </p>
			
			<b><p>How did you get started as an artist and why did you choose painting? </p></b>
    <p>I had a feeling of who I wanted to be from the beginning but I wasn't sure what I could call it nor was it clear for me how it was done.   I used to enjoy creating things like other kids but my uncle inspired me even though he didn’t make it as a plastic artist. He liked doing pottery and he knew how to draw too.  He taught me perspective, and it was hard for me to believe that a 3-dimensional drawing can be on a piece of paper. I found it very interesting and I think deep down I really wanted to be able to do that. It started way before I even decided to join the school of arts in Rwanda.</p>
			<p> I didn’t choose painting really, painting chose me. It feels like magic to see the world on the surface.            </p>
			
				<b><p>What mediums do you use?</p></b>
    <p>Acrylics, oil, charcoal and digital devices sometimes.</p>
			
							<b><p>What processes do you follow when creating?</p></b>
    <p>I always start with concept study. I sketch by using paints and working this way always helps me to create better and develop my observation. It’s like the whole process is a sketch. </p>

			<b><p>You intend to create hope and happiness using your imagination. Have you been able to achieve your goal? </p></b>
			<p>Not entirely but yes. I have received different reactions to my works and I am really happy with what it has brought to people.  What I hear most of the time is how they feel about the eyes in different pieces. My main inspiration for this projection of hope and happiness came when I was working on my first series called “share your smile”. It made me feel like there is power in sharing joy by giving the freest thing which is a smile.</p>
			
			<b><p>Can you talk about your current or upcoming projects?</p></b>
			<p>I’m currently working on a group Exhibition ‘VISAGE’ which is happening in December. Most importantly my solo exhibition is also happening soon, which I am so excited about.</p>
