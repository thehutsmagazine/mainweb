<p><strong>How did your journey start as an artist?</strong></p>

<p>Before I started painting, I was a 3d modeler. One day I tried designing my own characters, which came out ugly even though I spent so much time on it. Then I found out that the problem was because I had no sense of foundation art, so I started to learn how to sketch. Since then, I fell in love with traditional art and after studying fine art for five years, full time, I began to teach students as I started to build my art style.</p>


		<p><strong>Does your work have a story behind it or you just paint at random?</strong></p>

 <p> My artworks are like my mood diary. Sometimes it’s bright and colorful and sometimes it’s gloomy. Like in our daily life, we’re not always happy and we’re not always sad.

		<article><p><strong>I noticed the use of oil paint as your medium. Why did you choose it?</strong></p>

   <p>Every medium has it’s character and strong point. Oil paint not only can present very strong color but also can have plentiful text.</p>
