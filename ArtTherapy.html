Art therapy is a distinct discipline that incorporates creative methods of expression through visual art media.</p>
			
<p>It uses artistic methods to treat psychological disorders and improve mental health.
The goal of art therapy is to harness the creative process to help people explore self expression and in doing so, find new ways to gain individual discernment. </p>




<p>There are three main ways art therapy is applied. The first is Analytic art therapy, this involves the client, the therapist and the ideas exchanged between them through art. The second is Psychotherapy, it has to with the analysis of the client’s art work by the therapist. The third method is used by practitioners who see art as a therapy, they do not focus on verbal analysis but on the creation process of the client’s art work.</p>
<p>In art therapy, the client is made to explore his/her inner thoughts and emotions through the use of materials such as paint, paper, pen or clay. This helps in improving their sensory motor function, self esteem and emotional resilience.</p>
